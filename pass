80 bits on entropy is a safe amount to have in your password {https://pthree.org/2011/03/07/strong-passwords-need-entropy/}  

Level Segregation Criteria (draft):
a) on the basis of entropy of the resultant password
  * 60-75 bits, 75-85 bits 
b) on the basis of human time taken to complete the scheme
  * 30 secs - 1.5 mins
  * 2 mins - 4 mins 
c) on the basis of time complexity 



SCHEME 1
eg - facebook
step1- random words beginning with each f,a,c,...
step2- choose 6 digit key
step3- start at beginning and navigate through string
step4- each stop character becomes a character in the password

SCHEME 2
eg - amazon
step1- 4 letter pneumonic (eg amzn)
step2- think of objects starting with each of those letters (eg anaconda, mouse, zip, nut)
step3- primary color of each of those objects (browngreyblackbrown) is the password

SCHEME 3
eg - gmail
step1- write number corresponding to 1st letter (in this case 0 7) ----> (x1,x2)
step2- choose 2 numbers as key ---> (y1,y2)
step3- make eqn of line y = mx+c: for eg if eqn is 14y = 7x +13, password is '14y=7x+13'

###extended scheme 3
  choose 4 numbers giving 2 points and make a curve
  
SCHEME 4
eg: outlook
step1- same as above
step2- choose 2 other points such that these 3 points form a triangle. these 4 numbers are your key.
step3- choose 3 rand alphabets to name your triangle (say f,u,q)
step4- password is fu<length of FU>uq<length of UQ>qf<length of qf> (eg fu03uq11qf07 would be a password)

SCHEME 5
eg flipkart
step1- come up with 4 letter pneumonic (eg fpkt)
step2- songs starting with each of the letters
step3- 4 numbers as key
step4- corresponding words from the song

Scheme 6: 
eg flipkart
step1- reduce to 6 letters
step2- choose 6 digit key and apply caesar cipher (choose between left or right) 
step3- say resultant string after step2 is "c s g d a f". The corresponding numbers are 3, 19, ...
step4- Choose any book, magazine or text
step5- go the 3rd page and write down the first word starting with "c", 19th page and the first word starting with "s" (if you don't find "s", then "t" and so on till you find)
step6- say you wrote down the words "cycle", "yeast", "girl",... 
step7- now write down the 1st letter of the 1st word, 2nd letter of the 2nd word and so on... till you get 9 characters
step8- password is <9 characters you just got>+<key-th special character on keyboard>

Scheme 7:
eg google
step1- make 12*12 grid and populate it with alpha-numeric characters and even special characters (!,&,$,# etc). This is your template. 
step2- make a 4 letter pneumonic say, G O L E
step3- pick any 3*3 grid from the template (remember its starting position say B4) this is mini-template
step4- choose 4 digit key and apply hill cipher on gole
step5- trace out the G, O, L E on the mini-template 
step6- write down the characters along the path. You will get 4 strings.
step7- choose one of them as your password.
