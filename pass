80 bits on entropy is a safe amount to have in your password {https://pthree.org/2011/03/07/strong-passwords-need-entropy/}  

SCHEME 1
eg - facebook
step1- random words beginning with each f,a,c,...
step2- choose 6 digit key
step3- start at beginning and navigate through string
step4- each stop character becomes a character in the password

SCHEME 2
eg - amazon
step1- 4 letter pneumonic (eg amzn)
step2- think of objects starting with each of those letters (eg anaconda, mouse, zip, nut)
step3- primary color of each of those objects (browngreyblackbrown) is the password

SCHEME 3
eg - gmail
step1- write number corresponding to 1st letter (in this case 0 7) ----> (x1,x2)
step2- choose 2 numbers as key ---> (y1,y2)
step3- make eqn of line y = mx+c: for eg if eqn is 14y = 7x +13, password is '14y=7x+13'

###extended scheme 3
  choose 4 numbers giving 2 points and make a curve
  
SCHEME 4
eg: outlook
step1- same as above
step2- choose 2 other points such that these 3 points form a triangle. these 4 numbers are your key.
step3- choose 3 rand alphabets to name your triangle (say f,u,q)
step4- password is fu<length of FU>uq<length of UQ>qf<length of qf> (eg fu03uq11qf07 would be a password)

SCHEME 5
eg flipkart
step1- come up with 4 letter pneumonic (eg fpkt)
step2- songs starting with each of the letters
step3- 4 numbers as key
step4- corresponding words from the song

Scheme 6: 
eg flipkart
step1- 4 letter pneumonic (flkt)
step2- choose 4 letter key and apply hill cipher (say resultant string is
